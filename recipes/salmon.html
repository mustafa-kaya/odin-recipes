  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>Salmon is a very popular fish, being large and high in omega-3 fatty acids. Canned salmon is high in calcium because the bones have been softened and are eaten with the meat. Salmon is particularly popular in the American Jewish community. The eggs are sometimes eaten as a caviar substitute.</p>

  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>¼ cup maple syrup</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
    <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
    <li>¼ teaspoon garlic salt</li>
    <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    <li>1 pound salmon</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl, mix the maple syrup, soy sauce, garlic, garlic salt, and pepper.</li>
    <li>Place salmon in a shallow glass baking dish, and coat with the maple syrup mixture. Cover the dish, and marinate salmon in the refrigerator 30 minutes, turning once.</li>
    <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
    <li>Place the baking dish in the preheated oven, and bake salmon uncovered 20 minutes, or until easily flaked with a fork.</li>
